# BASIC_HEATER_CONTROL_SYSTEM


This project simulates a heater control system using an Arduino. It utilizes a DHT22 sensor to monitor temperature and activates a heater (simulated with an LED and relay) when the temperature drops below a set threshold. A buzzer is used to give voice feedback in case of overheating.
